# altConsole
A Javascript console that replaces the default inspect element. Was originally used in Clockwork for debugging on school Chromebooks. May or may not work - has not been updated in a long time.

Want to add it? Just put this `script` tag in an HTML file:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/red-stone-network/altconsole@main/altconsole.js"></script>
```
